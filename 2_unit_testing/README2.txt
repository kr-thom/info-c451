How to Run:
    1. Make sure MySQL is running and the `bookings` database is set up.
    2. Ensure the test script can connect to the database (check db_connection.php).
    3. From a terminal, navigate to this folder and run the test scripts.
    4. The script will output PASS or FAIL for each test case.
